# LABUGUEN-Stage-2
Stage 1: Modules and Express
In this stage, I created a Node.js file and utilized the Express module to define a route that responds with my favorite programming language when accessed via a GET request.

## Instructions
1. Create a new Node.js file and import the express module.
2. On your Express application, define a route that will respond with your favorite programming language whenever someone makes a GET request.
3. The URL you'll be using is http://localhost:3000/programming-language

## Running the Application
To run the Node.js application, make sure you have the Express module installed. 
You can install it by running the following command in your project's directory:
npm install express
node app.js

After running the above command, you should see a message indicating that the application is running on port 3000. 
You can then access the route by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:3000/programming-language.
